Description: The main additional functionalities offered by camtrapRassistant are
    the abilities of using more complex folder structure to extract metadata on 
    detections and use counts/group as criteria for independence, and will extend
    record tables based on these multiple detection or reformat tables where 
    metadata on detection is provided in different columns.
