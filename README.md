# camtrapRassistant
A R package that runs alongside camtrapR to provide more functionalities and flexibility


The main additional functionalities offered by camtrapRassistant are
    the abilities of using more complex folder structure to extract metadata on 
    detections and use counts/group as criteria for independence (that is, where
    more than one individuals is detected and this information is provided in the
    metadata, when selecting independent detection, the function will select the
    entry with the max count amongst the possible )

## Warning: 
This  package is in development and it is not to be used yet
